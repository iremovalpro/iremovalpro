## 🔥 What's New in Ultimate Edition?

This is not just another update. We have completely rewritten the **iRa1n** exploit core to achieve the impossible.

### 🚀 Key Features:

* **Full Signal Support (Sim fully working):** Forget about turning your expensive iPhone into an iPod. After the bypass, **Calls, SMS, and 4G/5G/LTE data** work perfectly. The device functions 100% like new.
* **iPhone 17 Series Support:** World's First! Exclusive support for the newest A17, A18, and A19 chipsets. We have successfully bypassed the next-gen Secure Enclave protection.
* **Untethered Bypass:** You can reboot your device, let the battery die, or power it off—the lock will **not** return.
* **OTA Blocker:** Built-in protection against accidental iOS updates that could patch the exploit.
* **No Jailbreak Needed (for A12+):** For newer models (iPhone XR and up), there is no need to struggle with checkra1n. Everything is handled internally by the software in a single click.
